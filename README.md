# nestR
Package nestR for locating nests and estimating bird reproductive outcome from GPS data

The package nestR includes functions to (1) identify nesting location along bird movement trajectories obtained from GPS tracking data and (2) estimate the outcome of nesting attempts based on patterns of revisitation. The package includes functions to run the analysis as well as interactive exploratory tools, data processing, and custom plotting functions. The package includes three example datasets, each containing GPS trajectories for 2 individual-years of the following species: wood storks (Mycteria americana), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), and Mediterranean gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus).
